BlockAndCache.hpp represents a block in a cache and a cache
Makefile

REMARKS:
In order to read the given file into the given buffer in the caching_read
method I used a class that I implemented representing a cache.
the cache is made out of blocks. each block has a file name, his own 
buffer, and the size of the buffer is size of block.
Furthermore, each block has its own "offset" that represents a
position in the file, that position is a multiplicity of size of block.
and a access member that changes his time according to the use in the block.
When we need to read a file into the given buffer, we want to read it from the 
cache to make the call 'read' much more faster. therefore, we want to load the 
blocks of the file into the cache, and then read the blocks from the cache into 
the given buffer according to the size we want to read.
if the block is already on the cache, we  read it to the buffer from the cache
without loading it.
Furthermore, in the Block class and in the Cache class I implemented
toString method for the ioctlFile.
